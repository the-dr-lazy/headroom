Would you like to have nice, up-to-date license/copyright headers in your source code files but hate to manage them by hand? Then __Headroom__ is the right tool for you! Now you can define your license header as [Mustache][web:mustache] template, put all the variables (such as author's name, year, etc.) into the [YAML][wiki:yaml] config file and Headroom will take care to add such license headers to all your source code files.

## Main Features
- __License Header Management__ - allows to add, replace or drop license headers in source code files.
- __Flexible Header Detection__ - you can even replace or drop license headers that weren't generated by Headroom, as they are automatically detected from source code files, not from template files.
- __Fully Customizable__ - would you like to put empty lines before/after header? Or use different style of comments for your headers? No problem, you can change this in configuration.

- __Template Generator__ - generates license header templates for most popular _open source_ licenses. You can use these as-is, customize them or ignore them and use your custom templates.
- __Automatic Initialization__ - using the _Init_ command, _Headroom_ can detect what source code files you have in your project and generate initial configuration file and appropriate template skeletons.
